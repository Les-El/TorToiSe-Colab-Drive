        "\n",
        "TorToiSe was developed by James Betker: https://github.com/neonbjb. It is a text-to-speech program built with the following priorities: Strong multi-voice capabilities, and highly realistic prosody and intonation. The repo contains all the code needed to run Tortoise TTS in inference mode, plus more like examples and documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "A YouTube video by Martin Thissen presented a Tortoise notebook which could handle much longer text files: https://youtu.be/FN3yxL0Rr0c. Please check it out for more details, and for an interface that isn't Google Drive dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook here, the \"Colab + Drive UI Edition\" is built on that notebook from YouTube, and is meant to be novice friendly. It is desgined to be run from top-to-bottom, once all settings have been chosen. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you have any questions or requests about the notebook, find me at https://discordapp.com/users/Lester#0973. The is a side/learning project for me, so I can't promise to address all issues. But I enjoy developing this notebook, so don't be shy!\n",
        "\n",
        "One more note from James Betker:\n",
        "> There's a reason this is called \"Tortoise\" - this model takes up to a minute to perform inference for a single sentence on a GPU. Expect waits on the order of hours on a CPU."
